which of these packages is unncecesary: library(here) 
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(janitor)
library(kableExtra)
library(DiagrammeR)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)

Determining whether a package is unnecessary depends on your specific needs and the functions you are using in your R script or project. However, I can give you some guidance based on common use cases:

here: This package is useful for managing file paths in your project. If you're not using it to manage file paths, it might be unnecessary.
tidyverse: This is a collection of packages (including dplyr, ggplot2, and others) that are commonly used for data manipulation and visualization. If you're not using any of these packages, you might not need tidyverse.
knitr: This package is used for dynamic report generation. If you're not generating reports dynamically, you might not need it.
janitor: This package provides functions for data cleaning tasks. If you're not using these functions, it might be unnecessary.
kableExtra: This package extends knitr and kable to produce nicely formatted tables. If you're not using it for table formatting, it might be unnecessary.
DiagrammeR: This package is used for creating and exporting diagrams and flowcharts. If you're not creating diagrams in your R scripts, it might be unnecessary.
dplyr: This package provides functions for data manipulation. If you're not using these functions, it might be unnecessary, especially if you're already using tidyverse.
readxl: This package is used for reading Excel files. If you're not reading Excel files, it might be unnecessary.
ggplot2: This package is used for data visualization. If you're not creating plots, it might be unnecessary.
Consider removing any packages that you're not using in your script or project to keep your environment clean and minimize dependencies. However, keep in mind that removing a package might mean removing functionality that you might need in the future.

like which are duplicates of each other

Among the packages you listed, there are indeed some that overlap in functionality:

tidyverse includes dplyr, ggplot2, and several other packages. If you are already loading tidyverse, loading dplyr and ggplot2 separately may be redundant.

knitr is often used alongside kableExtra for producing nicely formatted tables in dynamic documents. Since kableExtra extends knitr and kable, loading both might be redundant unless you need specific features from each.

Here's a summary:

If you're loading tidyverse, you might not need to load dplyr and ggplot2 separately.
If you're loading kableExtra, you might not need to load knitr separately.
Removing redundant packages can help streamline your code and make it easier to manage dependencies. However, be mindful of any specific functionality you might be using from each package that's not covered by the broader ones you're loading.
